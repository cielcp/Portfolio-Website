      <h2 class="heading-4">Background</h2>
      <p>As part of the <a href="https://joinforge.co/wireframe" target="_blank" class="link-ww">Forge Wireframe</a> curriculum, our three-person team embarked on a final project aimed at solving a real-life design challenge. Our group chose to tackle <span>the intricate process of ordering from UVA&#x27;s beloved food trucks</span>.<br>‍<br>Food truck culture thrives at UVA. However, as of recently the only way to order from food trucks online is through Grubhub’s campus dining feature. While some students adjusted to this new user journey, others found it difficult for a variety of reasons. Food truck owners, as local small businesses, are also burdened by the high vendor fees imposed by Grubhub.<br>‍</p>
      <h2 class="heading-4">The mission</h2>
      <p>UVA students needed an intuitive, dedicated, and comprehensive platform for ordering from the food trucks across grounds. <br></p>

      <h4 class="portfolio-tag color-grey">Part 1 - Market analysis</h4>
      <h2>Competitive study</h2>
      <p>As part of my research, I looked at the popular food delivery apps Grubhub and Uber Eats, as well as Good Uncle, a food truck app catering towards college campuses. This research was very beneficial to help me understand the market and learn the different screens and interfaces required of food ordering apps.</p>

        <li>Two distinct categories of users emerging: regular food trucks eaters and infrequent customers - the ultimate design should appeal to both personas</li>
        <li>Grubhub satisfies most users, positive elements of their design - a lot of Grubhub’s process, despite not being tailored to food trucks, is working for users</li>

I asked the survey questions listed above as well as the following additional questions:<br></p>
      <ul role="list">

      <h2>Issues with our team solution</h2>
      <p>While this is the initial design solution that our team arrived at, after the conclusion of the course I decided to revisit this project and redo the design process for the following critical reasons:</p>
      <ol role="list" class="travel-list">
        <li>I felt our team’s final design didn’t provide a novel solution for the specific user flow of ordering from UVA’s food trucks</li>

        <li>Our solution did nothing to improve the check-in and pickup process, which was the biggest pain point in users’ current experience with GrubHub campus dining. I decided I wanted to re-approach the design of this process; How can we keep the contactless check in process intuitive yet secure?</li>

        <li>Decided to change the home screen to a map view to account for the dynamic locations of food trucks, and to show the user’s current location and distance from food trucks</li>
        <li>Clarified that users could use the search bar to filter by hub location, food truck name, cuisine, or specific menu items</li>
        <li>Decided to add a calendar view as a tab to account for the fact that some users just want to check the food truck schedule instead of actually ordering</li>
        <li>Got rid of the orders tab as previous and favorited orders were already available more intuitively through the profile tab, and the recommended orders were available in the truck details screen.</li>
        <li>Selecting between the meal plan menu and regular menu was a notable annoyance of using GrubHub’s campus dining. I decided it made more sense for the meal plan menu to be a subsection of the regular menu, because the meal plan menus are quite small and there are less students with meal plans than without.</li>
        <li>In the checkout screen, include quick add and utensil inclusions (and more), and added text to clarify the favorites feature</li>
        <li>Only show check in button when user is at target location to eliminate need for physical tap check in at the cost of giving up location information. </li>
        <li>Show how users can add and change payment method during checkout or in their profile tab</li>
